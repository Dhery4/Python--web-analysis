# 📊 Website Data Analysis with Python

This project involves analyzing website performance data using Python. It covers data cleaning, transformation, and visual analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes user sessions, engagement metrics, traffic by hour and channel, and more.

## 📌 Key Steps
- Cleaned and formatted raw CSV export from Google Analytics.
- Converted date fields and numeric columns.
- Created multiple visualizations for insights:
  - Sessions & Users over time
  - Total users by traffic channel
  - Average engagement time by channel
  - Engagement rate distribution (boxplot)
  - Engaged vs Non-Engaged sessions
  - Hourly traffic heatmap
  - Engagement rate vs sessions trend line

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📷 Sample Visualizations
